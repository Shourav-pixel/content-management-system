The Collection


Deploy Link : https://content-management-system-iq2e.onrender.com


Project Highlights:
Collections & Items: Users can create collections and add items to them.
Interaction Features: Users can like and comment on items within collections, fostering community engagement.
Search Functionality: A search bar at the top of the page allows users to easily find collections.
JIRA Integration: From their dashboards, users can create JIRA issues within the corresponding project, streamlining task management.
Admin Controls: Admins have the authority to block, unblock, and delete users, ensuring the platform remains secure and user-friendly.
This project demonstrates my skills in building dynamic, user-centric web applications with extensive interactivity and administrative control. It also highlights my ability to integrate third-party services like JIRA for enhanced functionality.

Looking forward to connecting with fellow developers and exploring new opportunities!
